**General Principles for Phasing an ERP Implementation:**

1.  **Core First:** Start with the absolute foundational elements of the system.
2.  **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Focus:** Identify the smallest set of features that deliver tangible value to an initial set of users or for a core business process.
3.  **Build on Foundations:** Each phase should build upon the infrastructure and features established in previous phases.
4.  **User-Centric:** Prioritize features based on user needs and business impact.
5.  **Iterate:** Be prepared to adjust the plan based on learnings from earlier phases.

**Proposed Phasing Structure:**

Let's outline a potential multi-phase approach. The specifics of which exact *business features* go into each phase will depend on your ERP's primary domain (e.g., manufacturing, sales, HR, finance) and your initial target users.

**Phase 0: Foundational Setup & Core Infrastructure**

*   **Objective:** Establish the project structure, core configurations, CI/CD pipeline, and essential infrastructure components. No end-user business features yet, but a runnable "hello world" or basic health check API.
*   **Key Strategies & Setups to Implement:**
    *   **Project Structure (`project_structure.md`)**
    *   **Configuration Management (`configuration_management_strategy.md`)**: Pydantic Settings, `.env` setup.
    *   **Secrets Management (`secrets_management_strategy.md`)**: Initial setup for local dev, plan for AWS Secrets Manager.
    *   **Database & ORM (`database_strategy_postgresql.md`)**: PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy engine/session (`app/core/db.py`), Base model.
    *   **Migrations (`database_migration_strategy.md`)**: Alembic initialized.
    *   **Basic API Core (`api_strategy.md`)**: FastAPI app instance, basic error handlers, CORS.
    *   **Logging (`logging_strategy.md`)**: Initial structured JSON logging setup.
    *   **Development Setup (`development_setup_guide.md`)**: Docker Compose for app, PG, Redis.
    *   **Testing Environment (`testing_environment_setup.md`)**: Pytest, basic DB fixtures.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline (`deployment_strategy_and_ci_cd.md`)**: Initial pipeline for lint, test, Docker build & push. Maybe a manual deploy to a dev/test EC2.
    *   **Security (`security_strategy.md`)**: Basic security headers middleware.
*   **Deliverable:** A runnable FastAPI application with a health check endpoint, connected to a database, with basic CI.

**Phase 1: Identity, Access Management & Core Entities**

*   **Objective:** Implement user authentication, authorization (RBAC basics), organization management, and one or two fundamental business entities.
*   **Key Strategies & Setups to Fully Implement/Integrate:**
    *   **API Strategy:** JWT & API Key authentication dependencies, RBAC dependency stubs.
    *   **Security Strategy:** Full authentication logic, password hashing, basic RBAC service.
    *   **Database Models:** `User`, `Role`, `Permission`, `Organization`, and potentially one core business entity (e.g., `Product` if it's a product-centric ERP, or `Contact` if CRM-focused).
    *   **Validation Strategy:** Pydantic models for these entities.
    *   **Celery Basics (`asynchronous_celery_strategy.md`):** Get Celery app running, maybe one simple task (e.g., for post-registration email if Email Service is in this phase).
    *   **Email Service (`email_service_integration.md`):** Setup for sending welcome/password reset emails.
    *   **Testing Strategy:** Focus on API tests for auth and CRUD of core entities.
*   **Features:**
    *   User Registration, Login, Logout, Password Reset.
    *   API Key generation/management (basic).
    *   Organization CRUD.
    *   CRUD for 1-2 core business entities (e.g., simplified Product Management).
    *   Basic Role/Permission assignment (maybe via admin scripts initially).
*   **Deliverable:** Users can register, log in. Admins can manage organizations and a core entity. Basic RBAC in place.

**Phase 2: Expanding Core ERP Functionality & Essential Services**

*   **Objective:** Build out more core business process features and mature supporting services.
*   **Key Strategies & Setups to Fully Implement/Integrate:**
    *   **File Storage (`file_storage_strategy.md`):** Full implementation for local & S3, `StoredFile` model, related APIs.
    *   **Caching (`cache_redis.md`):** Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
    *   **Full RBAC:** Complete the RBAC service and permission checks across more entities.
    *   **Monitoring (`monitoring_strategy.md`):** Prometheus metrics, Sentry integration.
    *   **Celery & Custom Beat Scheduler:** Fully implement the custom DB Beat scheduler if complex scheduled tasks are needed now.
    *   **Localization (Content - `localization_strategy.md`):** Implement the translation tables and dedicated APIs for managing content translations for entities built so far.
    *   **Feature Flags (`feature_flags_strategy.md`):** Implement the basic system if needed to gate new Phase 2 features.
*   **Features (Examples, depends on ERP type):**
    *   More detailed Product Management (variants, attributes).
    *   Order Management (basic create, view, status updates).
    *   Inventory Management (basic stock tracking).
    *   Customer/Supplier Management.
    *   Features that heavily use file storage.
*   **Deliverable:** A more functional ERP capable of handling core business processes.

**Phase 3: Advanced Features, Integrations & Scalability Enhancements**

*   **Objective:** Add advanced modules, third-party integrations, and focus on performance/scalability.
*   **Key Strategies & Setups to Fully Implement/Integrate:**
    *   **Search (`search_strategy.md`):** Full Elasticsearch integration and indexing for key entities.
    *   **Real-time (`real_time_strategy.md`):** Implement Chat (WebSockets) and/or Video PaaS integration.
    *   **Automation Engine (PRD & Implementation):** Build the rule engine.
    *   **Export/Import App (PRD & Implementation).**
    *   **DB Operations API Module (PRD & Implementation):** If self-managed DB is a key scenario.
    *   **DB Scalability (`database_strategy_postgresql.md`):** Implement PgBouncer, consider read replicas, partitioning for high-volume tables identified.
    *   **Advanced Monitoring & Alerting.**
    *   **Full Deployment Automation (`deployment_strategy_and_ci_cd.md`):** Blue-green/canary deployments.
*   **Features:**
    *   Complex reporting and analytics.
    *   Third-party integrations (payment gateways, shipping).
    *   Full automation rule capabilities.
    *   Advanced search across the application.
    *   Chat and/or Video.
*   **Deliverable:** A feature-rich, scalable, and robust ERP system.

**Phase 4: Optimization, Maintenance & Further Evolution**

*   Ongoing performance tuning, security hardening, new feature requests, technology upgrades.
*   Potentially implement advanced tracing (OpenTelemetry), API Gateway, CDN.

**How to Use This Phasing Plan:**

1.  **Define Your MVP:** What specific business problems must your ERP solve in its first usable version? List the core entities and user stories.
2.  **Map MVP to Phases:** Assign your MVP features to Phase 1 or early Phase 2.
3.  **Identify Dependencies:** For each feature, list the underlying strategies/infrastructure it depends on. This will help validate the phasing of the strategies.
    *   *Example: If "Product Image Uploads" is an MVP feature, then `file_storage_strategy.md` needs to be implemented in Phase 1 or early Phase 2.*
4.  **Prioritize Strategy Implementation:** Implement the "General Setup" for strategies in the phase where their first dependent feature appears.
5.  **Iterate on Feature PRDs:** Once a phase's foundational strategies are set up, you'd then create detailed PRDs for the business features within that phase. Those PRDs will refer to the already-established strategy documents.

**Your Role & AI Agent's Role:**

*   **You:** Define the MVP, prioritize business features for each phase, make key decisions where [DECISION REQUIRED] is noted, and review the AI's output against the strategies and PRDs.
*   **AI Agent:** Takes the strategy documents and feature PRDs as input and generates the code for:
    *   The "General Setup" of each strategy in the appropriate phase.
    *   The "Integration & Usage Patterns" as it builds features.
    *   The feature-specific models, services, routers, and tasks.
